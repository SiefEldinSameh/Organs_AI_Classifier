## 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**  

### **Model Overview**  
- 🤖 Powered by a TensorFlow/Keras pre-trained model.  
- 📜 Outputs classes based on a JSON label file (e.g., `organ_model.json`).  
- Example JSON format for classification labels:  
  ```json  
  ["Brain", "Hand", "Liver", "Lung"]  
  ```  

### 🏋️ **Training a New Model**  
1. 📘 Open the `Training_notebook.ipynb` in the `training/` directory.  
2. 📂 Prepare your dataset and follow the steps outlined in the notebook.  
3. 💾 Save the trained model as `organ_model.h5`.  
4. 📝 Update the `organ_model.json` file to match the output classes of the new model.

## ⚙️ **Installation Guide**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- 🐍 **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.  
- 🖥️ **Git**: To clone the repository.  

### **Steps to Install**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MedicalOrganClassifier.git  
   cd MedicalOrganClassifier  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Place the Model Files**  
   - 🗂️ Add the pre-trained model file (e.g., `organ_model.h5`) to the `models/` directory.  
   - 📝 Ensure the `organ_model.json` file matches the class labels for the model and is placed in the `app/` directory.  

4. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash  
   python app/main.py  
   ```

## 📌 **Important Notes**  

### **File Compatibility**  
- 📂 The model file (e.g., `organ_model.h5`) and label file (`organ_model.json`) must correspond.  
- ✅ Ensure the number of classes in the model matches the labels in the JSON file.  

### 🛠️ **Common Issues**  
- ❌ **Error During Prediction**: Ensure the model and JSON file are compatible.  
- 🔍 **Verification**: Use the "Load Model" feature in the app to confirm compatibility.
